Amanda is a producer, film-maker, branding expert and sought-after public
speaker, sharing her 'Do Well By Doing Good” philosophy on stages around the
country. She demonstrates how both companies and individuals can make a
meaningful and positive difference in people’s lives, while fostering their own
success in the process. She believes that companies must not only identify their
brand purpose, but put that purpose into action.<br /><br />Through her work,
Amanda has defined what it looks like for brands to truly act 'as publishers”
creating movements through their content strategy. In her most recent
demonstration of this, Amanda was the Chief Brand Officer of Deluxe where the
brand challenge was to reach small businesses. The solution? She created,
produced and hosted their Emmy-nominated series 'Small Business Revolution,”
which streamed on Hulu and was named among Inc. Magazine’s top shows for
entrepreneurs. Through this inspirational reality show, Amanda was able to prove
the model of authentic content stretching a brand’s spend by achieving 12x the
reach through this series over traditional paid media. The program accumulated
over 13 Billion impressions, 6,000+ earned media articles and 20 million content
views (and counting). Not to mention - this work changed lives, families, small
businesses and communities across the country.<br /><br />Amanda is a nationally
renowned brand expert, Forbes contributor, and frequent on-camera personality
for national news outlets and celebrity interviews, ranging from LL Cool J to
Peyton Manning. She has appeared on CNBC’s 'Cleveland Hustles,” in addition to
hosting the online 'Small Talks” series that features successful entrepreneurs
across the country. That’s all while charting an acclaimed career that spans
groundbreaking campaigns for brands like BMW, Reebok and Sony, in addition to
her role as an inspiring female executive at Fortune 500 and Fortune 1000
companies, such as United Health Group, Allianz, General Mills, and Deluxe.
